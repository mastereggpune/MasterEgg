    <p class="lead">
         Master Egg was born when an idea sparked between two corporate junkies. The idea was simple, all we wanted was to serve something more healthy and hygienic than the regular scrambled eggs AKA anda-bhurji and omelette served with some bread or as we call it in India i.e. “pav” which is sold on every second street’s corner across the entire country.
     <br>
     <br>
        It just didn’t end there after all the creators were not just corporate junkies but also innovation maniacs and serious perfectionist at what they do. The goal wasn’t just to open a restaurant which servers egg dishes but to master the art of making good eggs and thus the name Master Egg.
        <br>
        <br>
      Every dish is built with a different set of ingredients and unique masala which gives the regular egg dish an amazing twist. Started in the month of July 2017, since then Master Egg’s motto was “thinking out of the shell” this was because in our initial days we wanted to experiment with new ideas for our dishes, understand our customer’s requirements and grow all together. Since our initial days business is constantly booming and our customers just love what we do.
      <br>
      <br>
       We started with a small two storey shop with a carpet area of roughly 1200 square feet. The ground floor was used for the kitchen and cash counter. While the first floor was used as a storage compartment. Outer open but shaded space was used as a customer’s seating area where they made memories in our restaurant whilst enjoying their favourite egg dishes.
       <br>
       <br>
       Just within one year, our restaurant was no more “just a restaurant business” but it had grown into a “brand” which mastered at making amazing egg dishes from scratch. Considering this fast paced growth and after a huge success at our first store in Katraj, Pune we decided that it’s time to scale up after which we soon opened our second store in Kharadi, Pune and we have never stopped to increasing our store count.
       <br>
       <br>
       We soon realized we make our customers happy with what we do and therefore our current motto is “happiness out of the shell” our promise is to stand up to that reputation every time we break an egg.
       <br>
