          <h1>A little something about our story</h1>
          <p>
            MasterEgg was born when an idea sparked between two corporate junkies. The idea was simple, all we wanted was to serve something more healthy and hygienic than the regular scrambled eggs AKA anda-bhurji and omelette served with some bread or as we call it in India i.e. “pav” which is sold on every second street’s corner across the entire country.</p>
          <p>
            It just didn’t end there after all the creators were not just corporate junkies but also innovation maniacs and serious perfectionist at what they do. The goal wasn’t just to open a restaurant which servers egg dishes but to master the art of making good eggs and thus the name MasterEgg. </p>
          <p>
            Every dish is built with a different set of ingredients and unique masalas which gives the regular egg dish an amazing twist. Started in the month of July 2017, since then MasterEgg’s motto was “thinking outside the shell” this was because in our initial days we wanted to experiment with new ideas for our dishes, understand our customer’s requirements and grow all together. We did this successfully and now we are older than a year business is booming and the most importantly our customers just love what we do. </p>
          <p>
           We soon realized we make our customers happy with what we do and therefore our current motto is “happiness outside the shell” our promise is to stand up to that reputation every time we break an egg. </p>

          <h1>A little something about our vision</h1>
          <p>
We started with a small two storey shop with a carpet area of roughly 1200 square feet. The ground floor was used for the kitchen and cash counter. While the first floor was used as a storage compartment. Outer open but shaded space was used as a customer’s seating area where they made memories in our restaurant whilst enjoying their favourite egg dishes. </p>
<p>
One year later, our restaurant was no more “just a restaurant business” but it had grown into a “brand” which mastered at making amazing egg dishes from scratch. Considering this fast paced growth and after a huge success at Katraj, Pune we decided that it’s time to scale up after which we soon opened our second store in Kharadi, Pune. </p>
<p>
Now MasterEgg is at two locations in Pune city. But do we want to stop there?
Obviously not! Our goal is to make the “MasterEgg” quality egg dishes available for our customers in any location they travel across India. This is why we are open to give like-minded and enthusiastic entrepreneurs an opportunity to join hands with us.<p ><a id="Franchise-us" href="franchise.html">Click here to franchise us with!</a></p>
